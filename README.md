# Dental Office reservation

Dental office booking management app made with ASP.NET Core (.NET8)

## TODO
    ### Disagreements with the trainer
    - remove logic from constructors and put them in static factory method (and make private the concerned constructors)
    - replace most of mock objects by stubs

    ### Additional features
     - integration tests (test containers?)
